 * platforms can't hold one open. One process, one port, real WebSockets —

 * reads configuration — hence the dynamic imports further down rather than
 * top-level ones, which would be hoisted above this call and see an empty
 * environment.
 *
 * In production the real values normally come from the container environment,
 * where this call simply finds nothing to load and does no harm.
