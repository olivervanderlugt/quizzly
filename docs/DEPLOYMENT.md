# Deployment

Quizzly is one container: Next.js and the Socket.IO server share a single HTTP
server and port. Anywhere that runs a Docker image and gives you a Postgres
database will work.

**It will not work on serverless platforms** (Vercel, Netlify Functions, Lambda)
without changes. A live quiz needs a persistent WebSocket connection, and
request/response serverless runtimes can't hold one open. See
[Vercel](#if-you-must-use-vercel) at the end.

## Before you deploy

Generate two secrets — separately, not the same value twice:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32   # SESSION_SECRET
openssl rand -base64 32   # ENCRYPTION_KEY
```

Set at minimum:

```
NODE_ENV=production
APP_ORIGIN=https://quiz.example.com     # exact, no trailing slash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...           # keep sslmode=require on managed DBs
SESSION_SECRET=...
ENCRYPTION_KEY=...
```

`APP_ORIGIN` must be exactly right. It drives WebSocket origin validation, so a
mismatch shows up as sockets that connect and immediately fail — the confusing
symptom being that pages load fine but no game ever starts.

The app validates all of this at boot and refuses to start if anything is
missing, still a placeholder, or if production is configured over plain HTTP.

Optional, each switching on one feature (leave unset and the app runs without
it — full annotated list in `.env.example`):

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...        # AI question drafting
SMTP_HOST=... EMAIL_FROM=... # password reset (any SMTP provider; plus
                             # SMTP_PORT/SMTP_USER/SMTP_PASS/SMTP_SECURE)
DATA_RETENTION_DAYS=90       # daily sweep of games older than N days
```

`SMTP_HOST` and `EMAIL_FROM` must be set together — boot refuses half a config.
The boot log states per feature whether it is on and, if not, which variable
switches it on.

## Railway

1. New project → Deploy from GitHub repo.
2. Add a **PostgreSQL** service. Railway injects `DATABASE_URL` automatically.
3. Set `APP_ORIGIN`, `SESSION_SECRET`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY` in the app service's
   variables.
4. Railway detects the `Dockerfile` and builds it.
5. Add a start command that migrates first:
   ```
   node_modules/.bin/prisma migrate deploy && node_modules/.bin/tsx server/index.ts
   ```

Railway supports WebSockets on its default proxy with no extra configuration.

## Render

1. New → **Web Service**, pointed at the repo, runtime **Docker**.
2. New → **PostgreSQL**, then copy its internal connection string into
   `DATABASE_URL`.
3. Set the other environment variables.
4. Health check path: `/api/health`.
5. Pre-deploy command: `node_modules/.bin/prisma migrate deploy`.

## Fly.io

```bash
fly launch --no-deploy          # keep the generated Dockerfile
fly postgres create
fly postgres attach <db-name>   # sets DATABASE_URL

fly secrets set \
  APP_ORIGIN=https://your-app.fly.dev \
  SESSION_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)" \
  ENCRYPTION_KEY="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"

fly deploy
```

A ready `fly.toml` is committed at the repository root — `fly launch
--copy-config --no-deploy` keeps it. It already has `internal_port = 3000`,
`auto_stop_machines = false` (a machine that suspends mid-game drops every
player's connection), the `/api/health` check, and migrations as the release
command.

## Plain VPS with Docker Compose

```bash
git clone <repo> /opt/quizzly && cd /opt/quizzly
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env: set APP_ORIGIN to your https:// domain and both secrets
docker compose up -d --build
```

Then put a TLS-terminating reverse proxy in front. Caddy is the least
error-prone, because it gets certificates automatically **and** proxies
WebSockets with no special configuration:

```caddy
quiz.example.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:3000
}
```

With nginx you must forward the upgrade headers explicitly — omitting them is
the single most common cause of "the site works but games never start":

```nginx
location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $host;

    # Set this authoritatively — do not append to a client-supplied value,
    # or rate limiting can be bypassed with a forged header.
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

    proxy_read_timeout 3600s;   # don't cut idle sockets mid-lobby
}
```

## Migrations

`prisma migrate deploy` only applies already-committed migrations. It never
generates, resets, or drops anything, so it is safe to run automatically on
every boot — which is what `docker-compose.yml` does.

Never run `prisma migrate dev` or `prisma db push` against production.

---

## Sizing

One instance handles a lot. A single Node process holds roughly 50k concurrent
WebSocket connections before you need a second, and a live quiz uses far less
CPU per connection than a chat app — traffic is bursty around question
boundaries and near-idle in between.

Practical guidance:

| Concurrent players | What you need |
|---|---|
| Up to ~500 | 512 MB / 1 vCPU. The default `MAX_PLAYERS_PER_GAME` |
| Up to ~5,000 | 1–2 GB / 2 vCPU, single instance |
| Beyond that | Scale up before scaling out — see below |

**Scale vertically first.** It is genuinely the right answer here, because
scaling out requires real changes.

---

## Running more than one instance

**Not supported today.** `REDIS_URL` is reserved for this and nothing consumes
it yet — the server warns at boot if it is set. Run exactly one instance and
scale it up, not out. What follows is the map for whoever builds it.

Two things are process-local and will break if you naively add instances behind
a load balancer:

**1. Live game state.** `GameRoom` holds the authoritative state in memory. Two
instances means two independent games under one PIN.

**2. Rate limiting.** `src/lib/rate-limit.ts` is an in-memory map, so limits
become per-instance.

To scale out you need all three of:

- **Sticky sessions** at the load balancer, so a game's sockets always reach the
  instance holding its state. This alone gets you most of the way, since a game
  is naturally partitioned by PIN.
- **`@socket.io/redis-adapter`**, so broadcasts reach clients on other
  instances. Set `REDIS_URL` and wire the adapter in
  `server/realtime/gameServer.ts`.
- **A Redis-backed `consume()`** in `src/lib/rate-limit.ts`. The interface was
  designed to be swappable — replace the function body, not the call sites.

The genuinely robust version moves game state into Redis so any instance can
serve any game. That is a real piece of work; don't take it on until you need it.

## Backups

The database holds everything. Nothing else is stateful — the container is
disposable.

```bash
# Compose
docker compose exec db pg_dump -U quizzly quizzly | gzip > backup-$(date +%F).sql.gz

# Restore
gunzip -c backup-2026-07-27.sql.gz | docker compose exec -T db psql -U quizzly quizzly
```

Managed Postgres providers do this for you. **Test a restore before you need
one** — an untested backup is a hypothesis, not a backup.

---

## Monitoring

- `GET /api/health` returns `200 {"status":"ok"}`, or `503` if the database is
  unreachable. Point your uptime monitor at it.
- The container `HEALTHCHECK` uses the same endpoint, so orchestrators restart a
  wedged instance rather than routing to it.
- Application logs go to stdout in the standard container fashion.

---

## If you must use Vercel

The app builds and runs on Vercel, but **live games will not work** — the
Socket.IO server can't run there. Options:

1. **Recommended: don't.** Deploy the container to Railway or Fly. It's a single
   image and takes minutes.
2. Split it: Next.js on Vercel, and a separate Node service for Socket.IO with
   `APP_ORIGIN` and CORS configured across both. You now operate two services
   and pay a cross-origin round trip on every game event.
3. Replace the transport with Server-Sent Events plus a polling fallback for
   answers. Workable, higher latency, and a meaningful rewrite of
   `server/realtime/`.
